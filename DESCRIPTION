Description: For any comparative (e.g. case-control) studies of alternative splicing,
    scisorseqr is the one stop shop for analyzing single-cell long read data. The linux 
    based package includes functions for barcode deconvolution from fastqs,
    integration with long read alignment tools like STARlong and minimap2,
    mapping and filtering of high confidence full-length spliced reads, and some
    handy tools to conduct and visualize differential splicing analysis.
